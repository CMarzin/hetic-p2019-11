        <h3>Now that the kickstarter campaign ended, the antsy lab team still communicate their joy and thanks for their community on their project page. They celebrated with funny GIF and pics of their ending project celebration.
        .</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="para_story">
        <p>At this time, Antsy labs package the fidget cube in their boxes, to send to funders, that will get it first hand. They kept all funders in touch of the manufacturing progress, believing that a good communication start with honesty and transparency. Pictures of the product, ready to be send are shared with all funders.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="para_story">
        <p>That’s the reason why they update constantly their funders’ emailing channel and actualities in Kickstarter. The Fidget Family needs to be informed of how the project is going, and they know it. Some informations are exclusively for the funders, even on Kickstarter actuality.</p>

        <p>The funds were used to pay the production of the fidget cube, but they also participated to finance the project, with 5 000$ of their own! They make the product manufactured all around the world, to deserve all their client. Some investors called Antsy labs to invest the Fidget Cube, but for now, they wish the cube to be 100% their.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="para_story">
        <p>Their top priority was also to produce a top quality fidget cube, even if it can take more time to deliver. The amount of work, due to the high number of clients and of course of products to craft, is new for Antsy labs, used to less massive projects, and they face off the difficulties to bring the fidget cube to life, and making it roll to our desk!
