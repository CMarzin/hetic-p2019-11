        <p>Before they decided to start the kickstarter campaign, they knew it was a risked bet, people around them couldn’t understand why they made this product. One of their previous campaign was less risky, lot of people know they want a Duet to charge their Apple product, but Fidget Cube, have to fill a need less common. However, after trying « Trio », that was similiar to duo, and less original, « Fidget Cube » can bring something new, for Antsy Labs, and for Kickstarter campaigns.e.</p>
