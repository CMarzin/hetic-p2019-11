        <h4>FEB 2016</h4>
        <h1>FIDGET</h1>
        <h1>CUBE campaign: </h1>
        <h1>The funds glides to kickstarter</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="description_story">
        <h3>The idea found, Antsy lab team launch the Fidget Cube august 30th 2016 and the campaign will stop october 20th 2016. They learnt a lot from their others project, and know how to listen, communicate and be honest with their funders and buyers. And now they are going to apply it to their new campaign.
        .</h3>

      <div class="para_story">
        <p>The main difference with their others project was their video presenting the “Fidget Cube”. Its aspect was made to be more like a commercial but also funnier than the videos presenting “Trio”, “Duet” and “Storm the Gate”. In those, we simply see text and the product, but not their face, or storytelling about it. 

        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="para_story">
        <p>This time the video tell their own story, how they love fidgeting everywhere with various things ( especially bubblewrap), and how they want it to be perceived more as a way to focus than a bothering thing for co-workers. Matthew McLachlan was the one in charge of the video, and their wives helped filming the rooftop part.</p>

    <div class="story_part1">
      <div class="para_story">
        <p>Their communication were on social network such as Antsy Labs’ Facebook page and youtube channel. The video got quickly viral on social network, helped by pages sharing it such as “NowThis Future”. All fidgeters were tagged by their friends, and talked about the “Fidget Cube” around them. The video even reached 25 millions view within 48 hours!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="para_story">
        <p>The Antsy Lab team felt impressed on how viral the video was, and are pretty proud of their success, beyond all their kickstarters project.
        The kickstarter project should have brought at least 500 000 $ but the project brought over 6.4 millions dollars!
